# SERP Analysis Methodology

How to systematically analyze search results for competitive insights.

## What to Extract from Each Result

| Data Point | How to Get | Why It Matters |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| Title | WebFetch → `<title>` | Keyword targeting strategy |
| H1 | WebFetch → `<h1>` | Primary topic signal |
| Word count | WebFetch → count text words | Content depth benchmark |
| H2/H3 headings | WebFetch → extract all | Content structure blueprint |
| Schema types | WebFetch → `<script type="application/ld+json">` | Structured data expectations |
| Content format | Analyze structure | Guide vs listicle vs comparison |
| Images count | WebFetch → count `<img>` | Visual content expectations |
| Internal links | WebFetch → count same-domain links | Site authority signals |
| Publication date | WebFetch → datePublished or visible date | Freshness requirement |

## Content Format Decision Matrix

| SERP Pattern | Recommended Format |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Top results are step-by-step guides | **Tutorial/Guide** with HowTo schema |
| Top results are "X best..." lists | **Listicle** with numbered items |
| Top results compare options | **Comparison** with tables |
| Top results answer a specific question | **Direct answer** (Featured Snippet target) |
| Mixed formats | **Comprehensive guide** combining formats |
| Top results are product pages | **Product/Service page** with offers |

## Identifying Content Gaps

### Questions to Ask
1. What topics do ALL top results cover? (table stakes — must include)
2. What topics do SOME cover? (differentiators)
3. What topics does NONE cover? (your unique opportunity)
4. Are any results outdated? (freshness opportunity)
5. Are any results shallow/thin? (depth opportunity)

### Common Gap Types
- **Freshness gap**: top results have old data, you can provide current
- **Depth gap**: top results are surface-level, you can go deeper
- **Format gap**: no visual content, you can add infographics/videos
- **Audience gap**: all target experts, you can target beginners (or vice versa)
- **Angle gap**: same perspective everywhere, you can offer unique viewpoint
- **Data gap**: no original research/data, you can provide proprietary insights

## Competitive Strength Assessment

For each competitor page, rate 1-5:

| Factor | Score 1-5 |
|--------|-----------|
| Content depth | How thorough is the coverage? |
| Content freshness | How recent is the data? |
| Visual content | Images, videos, infographics? |
| Structured data | Schema.org present and rich? |
| User experience | Easy to read, navigate, use? |
| Authority signals | Author bio, citations, backlinks? |
| Unique value | What can't be found elsewhere? |

## Output: Actionable Insights

After SERP analysis, summarize:

1. **Minimum viable content**: what you MUST include to compete
2. **Differentiation angle**: your unique approach
3. **Target word count**: SERP average + 20% (to outperform)
4. **Recommended schema**: based on what Google rewards for this query
5. **Recommended format**: based on SERP pattern analysis
6. **Key questions to answer**: from "People Also Ask" and forum mining
